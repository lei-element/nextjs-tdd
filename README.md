# TDD Example Project

This project is a basic example of using Test-Driven Development (TDD) with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org). It aims to demonstrate the benefits and practices of TDD to our team, encouraging a more robust and reliable development process.

Before starting the project, we used Lucid to brainstorm. [Click here](https://lucid.app/lucidspark/cd94075f-4149-4eb4-a741-5c412a38c7ff/edit?invitationId=inv_a73e707b-e4b3-40bc-b14b-4d3f354c6601&page=0_0#) to visit the Lucid document.

## Goals

* Promote TDD: Show the advantages of writing tests before code.
* Improve Code Quality: Ensure our code is reliable and maintainable.
* Foster Collaboration: Encourage team members to adopt TDD in their daily workflow.

## Team Members

1. Mike
2. Michelle
3. Lei
4. Max

## Tools and Libraries

* Next.js - A React framework
* Jest - A JavaScript testing framework
* SQLite - A free and open-source relational database

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

### Getting Started via Docker

1. Installed [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/windows-install/)
2. In the project root directory, run `docker compose up`.

Note: Once you successfully run the `docker compose up` command and create the required container, you can control the container using Docker Desktop without needing to run the command each time.

## Challenges and Solutions

Document any challenges we encounter and how we resolve them.

## Progress Updates

Keep a log of our progress, including what was accomplished each week.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.
